    "The planned structure of project is showing below, right now I only finished the dataset_split.ipynb part, in which I try to get some insight of the PlantVillage dataset, and make the train/test set split with and without consideration of class imbalanced problem, which is ignored in the original publication (Mohanty SP, Hughes DP, SalathÃ© M. Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection. Front Plant Sci 2016; 7:1419.). Next, I will use classic Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architechture, such as AlexNet, VGG 16/19, Xception and ResNet50 to train the plant disease model. For learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameter in deep learning, and I will take advantage of the most advanced strategies to figure out the optimal value and optimal traing process, such as differential learning rates, cyclical learning rates, Cosine annealing, stochasitic gradient descent with warm restarts, and so on."
